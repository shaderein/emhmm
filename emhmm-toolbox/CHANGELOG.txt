--- CHANGE LOG ---
v0.80 2021/09/10
- added co-clustering (handles stimuli with different configurations)
- added VB co-clustering (co-clustering w/ automatic selection of numbers of groups and ROIs)
- added co-clustering and VB co-clustering demo
- added VB clustering (automatically select numbers of groups for clustering)
- added VB clustering demos
- new support functions: read in data for co-clustering (read_xls_fixations2, preprocess_fixations)
- new support functions: save figure as image (savefigs), print cell table

v0.78 2021/07/20
- new functions for computing conditional and marginal entropies of an HMM
- new demo for computing entropy (demo_faces_entropy)
- new function to permute VHEM clusters (vhem_permute_clusters)
- new function to compute symmetric KL divergence (stats_ttest_skl)
- vbhmm_learn now supports specifying a fixed set of ROIs (fixed_rois option)
- stats_ttest computes Cohen's d
- read_xls_fixations now supports ignoring fixations outside of rectangular or elliptical region(s).
- vbhmm_plot_compact, vhem_plot, and vhem_plot_fixations - added option to plot transition matrix on the bottom.
- added FAQ in documentation.
- various bug fixes
- Note: co-clustering code will be released in the next version.

v0.77 2020/03/12
- beta code for co-clustering (cocluster directory)
- various bug fixes

v0.76 2019/06/15
- for CogSci2019 tutorial: new demo and tutorial slides
- various bug fixes

v0.75 2019/02/22
- use parallel for loop (parfor) to improve speed (if Parallel Computing Toolbox is available).
- add vbopt.seed and hemopt.seed to seed the random number generator for reproducible results.
- NOTE: an error will occur if you don't set the seed explicitly in vbopt/hemopt.
- updated demo files to use vbopt.seed and hemopt.seed.
- NOTE: you will need to update your experiment scripts to use vbopt.seed and hemopt.seed.
- improved visualizations: text in figures now scale with the figure size.

v0.74 2019/01/12 (internal)
- can pass images directly to plotting functions.
- grayscale option for figures
- new functions: vbhmm_entropy, vbhmm_random_sample
- handle empty HMMs in VHEM
- fixed consistency with older versions of MATLAB.
- improve numerical stability.

v0.73 2018/06/13
- vbhmm_standardize: add option to sort ROIs by steady-state probabilities of ROIs
- vhem_cluster: add option to remove empty ROIs in the input HMMs (set by default)
- new functions: vbhmm_prob_steadystate
- bug fixes: VHEM with one ROI or tau=1 (thanks, Sara!)
- internal cleanup

v0.72 2018/05/19
- added holistic/analytic representative models from PBR paper
- support for MEX files in Linux
- updated support for fixed groups is vbhmm_learn
- new hyp optimization option: added 'W0log' and min/max hyp values
- added support functions: vbhmm_remove_empty
- plotting: added color labels for states
- bug fixes: check for valid v0 hyperparameter
- various improvements to numerical stability

v0.71 2018/02/01
- small bug fixes (Thanks Joe and Louis!)

v0.70 2017/08/26
- added automatic estimation of HMMs hyperparameters (vbhmm_learn, vbhmm_learn_batch)
- added automatic selection of initialization for VHEM clustering.
- added full covariance matrices for VHEM clustering (now default)
- removed dependency on Image Processing toolbox.
- improved speed using MEX files and other MATLAB tricks.

v0.64 2016/06/07
- (internal release)
- bug fixes.
- code cleanup for VHEM.

v0.63 2017/05/25
- added check for updates.
- added stats_meanll - calculate mean LL for each subject.
- added stats_stateseq - find the most likely ROI sequences.
- updated face_demo to show the above two new analyses.
- added conversion between different face images, and associated demo.
- bug fixes.

v0.62 2017/05/24
- added support for more colors when plotting.
- better plotting for large number of ROIs.

v0.61 2017/05/17
- BUG FIX in vbhmm_ll - length-1 sequences were accidently normalized as length-2 sequences.
  This may affect some log-likelihood correlation tests. T-tests should not be affected much
  since the difference between data LL of two HMMs is used.
- remove vbhmm_ll_OLD
- add support for 'gmm' initialization in VHEM-HMM

v0.6 2017/02/13
- minor bug fixes in vbhmm_fb (doesn't affect results)
- code cleanup for vbhmm_em

v0.5 2016/01/21
- updated to handle fixation duration with xy; bug fixes; automatically select some hyperparameters.
- updated for Antoine: options for gmdistribution.fit (random_gmm_opt); 

v0.4 2016/01/13
- added xls reader and demo; use random initialization; added documentation (docs)

v0.3 2016/12/09
- added more demos, added component splitting for initialization (random init is still better).

v0.2 2016/11/21
- added HEM clustering, ttest for HMMs, rearranged source files, added demo code

v0.1 2016/08
- initialize VB with ROIs, and use fixed ROIs
